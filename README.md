# House-Price-Prediction
This Project was completed as part of a competition on Kaggle. In this I have used myriad approaches to predict Sale Price of Houses present in the dataset, on basis of 80 distinct features. Different feature scaling and binarization techniques and different regression algorithms were used to arrive at a **Root Mean Squared Log Error** of *0.1265*.

Methods Used - 
1. Linear Regression with Numerical Features
2. Linear Regression with complete binarized feature space
3. Linear Regression with extensive feature scaling and selection
4. Random Forest Regression
5. XGBoost Regression
6. Light Gradient Boosting Regression
